# softuni-wp-for-developers-march-2023-exam

My "SoftUni WordPress for Developers - March 2023" exam project.

Includes custom theme and plugin files.

Plugin initializes a single CPT - Home.
It adds a couple of taxonomies for the class  - Country and location (city).

Most of the meta data is filled with custom meta boxes

The theme also displays blog posts, but the main focus is the properties/homes posts.
